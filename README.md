# Maze Solver for Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project is a simple yet captivating program designed to generate and solve mazes right on your Raspberry Pi. Leveraging popular maze-solving algorithms—Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)—it provides both an educational and entertaining experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Maze Generation**: Each run gives you a unique maze to solve!
- **Choice of Algorithms**: Switch between DFS and BFS to see different solving strategies in action.
- **Interactive UI**: Thanks to Python's Pygame library, the whole experience is visually engaging.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/AdrianSchlegel/Raspberry-Pi-Maze-Solver.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the setup script to automatically install required packages.
3. **Run the Program**: Launch it and start solving mazes!

## How It Works

Upon launch, the program automatically generates a new maze. You then have the option to solve it using either DFS or BFS. Sit back and watch the algorithm make its way from the starting point to the destination!
